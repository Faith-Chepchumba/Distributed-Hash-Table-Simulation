# Distributed Hash Table (DHT) Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a basic Distributed Hash Table (DHT) using consistent hashing. Nodes are assigned an ID, and key-value pairs are distributed among nodes based on their hash.

## Features

- Add and remove nodes dynamically.
- Store and retrieve key-value pairs.
- Consistent hashing to assign keys to nodes.

## Technologies Used

- Java

## How to Run

1. Compile and run the project: `javac Main.java && java Main`.

2. The simulation will add nodes and demonstrate key storage and retrieval.
